From directory that contains sonication_station-master folder(local machine):
scp -r ./sonication_station-master jubilee@192.168.1.2:/home/jubilee

From sonication_station-master on rbp:
pip install -e . --find-links=home/jubilee/sonication_station-master

I think this is the command to start interactive prompt mode (run from ./sonication_station-master):
python -m sonication_station.sonication_station
